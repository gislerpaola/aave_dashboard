# Aave Wallet Tracker - Improved Version

This is an updated version of the Aave Wallet Tracker. While the core functionality remains the same‚Äîproviding a secure, local Python application to track multiple Aave wallets on the Polygon network and integrate cryptocurrency price tracking‚Äîthis release focuses on **significant user experience enhancements** and the inclusion of visual elements.

## ‚ú® What's New

* **Enhanced User Interface (GUI):** We've completely overhauled the graphical user interface for a more intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience. The dashboard is now cleaner and more efficient for monitoring your DeFi positions.
* **Integrated Application Logo:** The application now features a custom logo directly within the GUI for better branding and a polished look.

## üñºÔ∏è Logo File Requirement

To ensure the application loads correctly and displays the logo, you will need the `logo_raw_b64.txt` file. This file contains the base64 encoded image data for the application's logo.

**Please ensure that `logo_raw_b64.txt` is placed in the same directory as the main script (`.py` file) when you run the application.**

## üöÄ Getting Started (Existing Users)

If you're upgrading from a previous version, simply replace your old project files with the new ones. Remember to include the `logo_raw_b64.txt` file in the same directory as your main script. Your existing `wallets.encrypted` and `salt.bin` files should be compatible.

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

We're committed to making your DeFi tracking experience as smooth and informative as possible. This update aims to provide a more refined and visually rich tool while maintaining the robust security and functionality you expect.
